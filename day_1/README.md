## Day 1

Day 1 we will introduce the followings

1. C programming Language
2. Arduino IDE

#### C Programming

C programming Language places a very big role in the programming of micro controller boards , because we often use the `Arduino IDE` to program those chips . Arduino IDE uses `C` like **syntax**

> [!NOTE]
> Arduino IDE support Additional Types such as `Strings` etc

#### Arduino IDE

1. Serial Monitor
2. Simple calculator
3. Built in LED Controller
4. Push button interfacing
5. Sensor Interfacings
   - UltraSonic Sensor
   - Temp/Humidity Sensor
